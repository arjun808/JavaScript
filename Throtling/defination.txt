 Specifically, it ensures that a function is called at most once within a specified period of time, 
 regardless of how many times the triggering event occurs. Throttling is commonly used to improve performance and resource utilization
  in scenarios where events are fired frequently, such as scrolling, resizing, or button clicks.
