Debouncing is a programming technique used to ensure that a function is invoked only after a specified period of inactivity. 
It prevents a function from being called multiple times in quick succession by delaying its execution until a certain amount of time
 has passed since the last call. This is particularly useful for handling events that fire frequently, such as keystrokes, window resizing, 
 or scroll events,  to improve performance and resource utilization.
